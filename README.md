# Weirdle

ðŸ”— -no website yet-

Weirdle is a very weird, unusual and unrealistic version of Wordle. The game is powered by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). and has been forked from [Canuckle](https://github.com/canucklegame/canuckle).

## How to Play

Guess the WEIRDLE in 6 tries.
Each guess must be a 5 letter word*. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the colour of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Grey: The letter is incorrect.

The answer will be a word/place/random thing that has nothing to do with society! (or maybe, depends)

A new WEIRDLE will be available each day!
